# todoApp
A simple website that makes a todo list for a user using MongoDB

Made using Node.JS

TO RUN:
- I coded using VS Code on a MacBook Pro
- put todo.ejs and todoEdit.ejs in a folder called "views"
- also put style.css in a folder called stylesheets in a larger folder called public
- put todoTask.js in a folder called models

Make sure to download node.js to the file along with npm packages express, mongoose, ejs and dotenv.
Also install nodemon
